# Impact of AI Tools on Student Productivity

**Tool Used:** Power BI  
**Data Source:** Google Form Survey (Student Responses)  
**Duration:**  Oct 2025  
**Author:** Kavivendhan V S

## Purpose
To analyze how the use of AI tools impacts student productivity, learning behavior, and satisfaction through data-driven visualization in Power BI.

---

## Project Overview
This project explores how students use AI tools (like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot) in their academic activities and how it affects their productivity and learning outcomes.  
The survey responses were collected via Google Forms, cleaned, and visualized in Power BI to uncover meaningful patterns and insights.

---

## Process Workflow
1. **Data Collection** â†’ Google Form responses on AI usage, perception, and impact.  
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation** â†’ Using Power Query in Power BI.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â†’ Identifying patterns and trends in usage behavior.  
4. **Dashboard Design** â†’ Creating five interactive pages with charts and KPIs.  
5. **Insights & Recommendations** â†’ Drawing actionable conclusions.
